##Car Parking System
# Car Parking System using Sensors 
#Car Parking System with mention available slots
#Introduction
The Car Parking System automates parking space management using Arduino-based technology. It employs IR sensors to detect vehicle presence at entrance and exit points, a servo motor to control the gate barrier, and a 20x4 LCD Display for real-time information display.

#Key Components
1. Arduino Uno: Central control unit for system operations.
2. 20x4 LCD Display: Presents parking slot availability and system messages.
3. IR Sensors: Detects vehicle presence at entrance and exit points.
4. MG995 Servo Motor: Controls the gate barrier to allow or deny access.
   
## System Functionality

1. Entrance Monitoring: IR sensors detect incoming vehicles. If space is available, the gate barrier opens, allowing entry; otherwise, entry is denied.
2. Exit Monitoring: IR sensors detect exiting vehicles. The gate barrier opens to allow exit, updating available parking slots.
3. LCD Display: Provides real-time updates on total slots, available spaces, and status of individual parking slots.

##Conclusion

The Car Parking System demonstrates an automated solution for managing parking spaces efficiently. It controls vehicle entry and exit, manages available parking slots, and provides users with real-time parking status updates.

#Key Features

1. Automated parking slot management.
